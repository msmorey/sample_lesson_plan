# Scout the Competition

## Instructions
In this activity, you'll be scouting out some of the alternatives to Hadoop and Spark: many of the tools you'll find will use buzzwords or jargon in their advertising, so don't worry if there are things you don't understand. The point of this excercize is to better understand where Hadoop and Spark fit in the larger picture of Big Data processing tools.

* Search the web for some of the competitors to Hadoop and Spark

* Take special note of when they were released, how many companies currently use them, and what each product claims to do better than the others.

**Hint:** If you're having trouble finding good alternatives, take a look at those mentioned in [this article](https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-hadoop-alternatives-consider-big-data/).

## Bonus

* Go through any of the activities from last week and attempt to convert them to run within a Jupyter Notebook. While doing this, try to split up the code into cells and print out the outputs.
